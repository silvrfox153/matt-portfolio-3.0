            In the summer of 2016, my employer announced a plan to restructure
            the operations organization. Part of that plan was to transition my
            teamâ€™s responsibilities to the Ireland office by the end of the
            year, thereby eliminating the Real Time Operations team in Boston.
            In February of 2017, my brother Sean talked to me about his interest
            in running for Cambridge City Council, he needed a campaign manager
            and a website. At that time, I knew nothing about running a
            political campaign or how to build a website. But because I needed a
            new project and because it was my brother, I dove right in. Fast
            forward to today and I&apos;ve had the privilege of managing three
            political campaigns, building four campaign websites, an e-commerce
            website, and a small business website.
