            Back in 2017, my brother Sean talked to me about his interest in
            running for office in the City of Cambridge and he needed a Campaign
            Manager and a website. At that time I knew nothing about running a
            political campaign or how to build a website. Fast-forward to today,
            and I&apos;ve had the privilege of managing three campaigns,
            building four campiagn websites, as well as an ecommmece website,
            and a small buiness website. My main focus these days is learning
            new technologies.
